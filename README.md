## How to Play

Step One:
Get the latest version of SMAPI, an open-source modding API for Stardew Valley 
```
https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases
```

Step Two: Add Anniversary to your mods folder:
```
cd (... filepath)/Stardew\ Valley/Contents/MacOS/Mods
git clone https://github.com/githubschman/Anniversary
```

Step Three: Replace your mail.xnb file with the one provided in this mod. The path should look like this:

```
yourname/library/applicationsupport/steam/steamapps/common/stardewvalley/contents/resources/content/data/mail.xnb
```

I included the unpacked mail.yaml file in this repo as well, if you wanted to take a look at the new messages you'll have!


## About the Mod:

If you are married before you download this mod, don't worry! Your anniversary date will be calculated based off of the current day, and how many days you've been married. If you get married while this mod is installed, your wedding day will be your anniversary. 


Once your anniversary date is calculated, it will be written to the mod's config.json file. Feel free to edit this file for testing, or if you just want to make your anniversary come a bit sooner! ;)

On the day before your anniversary, a letter will be queued to your mailbox from your spouse (which is weird because you live together, but whatever) containing a special anniversary present. On the day of your anniversary, your spouse will say a sweet message, based off of how many years you've been married, whether you have children, and what you specified as your "favorite thing" in the beginning of the game.

When you go to the location where you had your wedding, memories of your wedding day will come flooding back and your wedding song will play!
