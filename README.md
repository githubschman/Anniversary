## How to Play

Get the latest version of SMAPI, an open-source modding API for Stardew Valley 
```
https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases
```

Step One: Add 'Anniversary to your mods folder:
```
cd (... filepath)/Stardew\ Valley/Contents/MacOS/Mods
git clone https://github.com/githubschman/Anniversary
```

Step Two: Replace your Mail.xnb file with the one provided in this mod. The path should look like this:

```
yourname/library/applicationsupport/steam/steamapps/common/stardewvalley/contents/resources/content/data/mail.xnb
```

I included the unpacked mail.yaml file in this repo as well, if you wanted to take a look at the new messages you'll have!


## About the Mod:

If you are married before you download this mod, don't worry! Your anniversary date will be calculated. If you get married while this mod is installed, your wedding day will be your anniversary.

On the day before your anniversary, a letter will be queued to your mailbox from your spouse (which is weird because you live together, but whatever) containing a special anniversary present. On the day of your anniversary, your spouse will say a sweet message. When you go to the location where you had your wedding, memories of your wedding day will come rushing back and your wedding song will play!
